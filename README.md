## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Advanced Mathematical Functions**: 
  - Trigonometric functions: sin, cos, tan, cot, and their inverses.
  - Factorial computation.
  - Logarithmic functions (base 10 and natural logarithm).
  - Square roots and nth roots.
  - Power calculations (including negative and fractional powers).
- **Percentage Calculation**: Calculate percentages easily.
- **Graphing Functions**: Visualize mathematical functions like sine, cosine, and tangent.
- **Error Handling**: Displays errors for invalid calculations.

## Getting Started

To use this scientific calculator in your project, follow the instructions below.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually comes with Python installations)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install NumPy and Matplotlib using pip:

      pip install numpy matplotlib

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/scientific-calculator.git
    cd scientific-calculator

2. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python calculator.py
This will open the calculator GUI.

## Usage
The calculator GUI consists of:

- An entry field to display the current input or result.
- Buttons for numbers (0-9), basic operations (+, -, *, /), and advanced functions.
- Buttons for trigonometric and logarithmic calculations.
- A button to clear the entry field and another to delete the last character.
- Graph buttons to plot sine, cosine, and tangent functions.

## Examples

- To calculate the sine of 30 degrees:
  - Enter `30`
  - Click the sin button.
  - The result will display in the entry field.

- To calculate 5! 5!:
  - Enter 5
  - Click the x! button.
  - The result will display in the entry field.
   
- To visualize the sine curve:
  - Click the button corresponding to the sine graph, and the plot will display.
 
## Testing
Make sure to test the functionality of each feature to ensure everything works as intended. You can create test cases for different mathematical operations and graphing features.
